Online library 

Tools:
WEB - Servlets & JSP (basically scriplets);
Application Server - GlassFish;
DBMS - MySQL;
IDEA - NetBeans;

Note. Reader of books use old applet and it is not signed.
But you can use it by whitelisting it in java security option. I haven't found better way yet.
Maybe I need to replace this applet for new one.
